Wanna show off a little at a family gathering? This will hit all the right buttons!

My husband and I are huge fans of the Great British Baking Show. It’s very calming to watch and my favorite thing is to point and yell out the cute things in the background (I'm a big sucker for flowers and anything with polka dots). 

This recipe is from their Christmas special edition and this is one of the best desserts I’ve ever made. Here’s the recipe I noted down from BBC with a few additions of my own. 

## Ingredients

#### For the pavlova

* 6 large egg whites
* 350g/12oz castor sugar
* 1 tsp white wine vinegar 
* 1 tsp cornflour
* For the filling
* 600ml/20fl oz double cream
* 1 tsp vanilla bean paste
* 50g/1¾oz icing sugar, sifted
* Strawberries hulled and quartered
* Raspberries
* Blueberries 
* Pomegranate seeds
* Cherries
* Blackberries 
* A few mint leaves, to decorate 
* Icing sugar for dusting

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment and draw a 30cm/12in circle in the middle of the paper. Draw a 15cm/6in circle in the centre of the larger circle to make a ring. 

_\*Gas mark 3 is 325 F_

_\*You can also make one single circle if you don’t have a big enough pan. Thats what I did and I used a pizza tray_ ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

2. Put the egg whites in a clean mixing bowl and whisk with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the sugar a little at a time, whisking on maximum speed until they are stiff and glossy. Mix the vinegar and cornflour in a cup until smooth, then stir into the egg whites.

_\*Make sure the eggs are at room temperature. I kept the eggs outside the night before. Some people immerse the refrigerated eggs in warm water but it’s a terrible idea. The egg whites won’t get fluffy and it’ll just be flat and runny._ 

_\*Its crucial not to get any egg yolk in the whites. Break one egg at a time to separate bowls._

_\*The mixing bowl has to be squeaky clean. Any trace of grease is a big no no for fluffy egg whites._

3. Spoon the meringue onto the ring drawn on the baking parchment. Using a large spoon make a shallow trench in the meringue for the cream and fruit to sit in.

_\*If you’re just going to make a circle like I did, make a shallow well in the middle for all the fruit to sit in. No need to make it neat ;)_

4. Transfer to the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 140C/120C Fan/Gas 1. Bake for 1 hour–1 hour 15 minutes, until the outside is hard but still white. Turn the oven off and leave the pavlova inside for an hour or overnight to cool and dry.

_\*Gas 1 is 275 F. As tempting as it is, don’t open the oven door as soon as the timer is done. The pavlova has to cool down sloooowly. If it cools down too quickly, it’ll have big cracks on it. Also note that slight small cracks are completely normal._

5. To assemble, whip the cream, vanilla paste and icing sugar until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Spoon the cream into the trench in the meringue. Arrange the cherries, berries and pomegranate on top and decorate with a few mint leaves. 

_\*For a snowy effect, use either a shaker or a strainer to dust a bit of icing sugar on top just before serving. Small step, but a big difference!_

As for the taste, 

It. Was. Amazing. 

It’s not at all heavy, the light texture of the merengue and the cream with berries are the perfect combo for a dessert after a heavy meal. 

It was a hit with even the fussiest eaters (me.)
