I always opt for tasty, yet easy things to make. Call it a lazy wife’s guide to cooking if you will. And this is one of the first meals I made and I scored big. Best of all, this only takes one pot, so less dishes to clean!

## Ingredients

#### for 4 servings

* 1lb shrimp - rinsed, peeled and deveined
* 4 cups spinach (I prefer baby spinach)
* 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
* 8 oz fettuccine pasta
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* 1⁄2 tsp italian seasoning
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 cup chicken broth
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1⁄4 cup grated parmesan
* Extra cheese to garnish
